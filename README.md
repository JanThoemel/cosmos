Implement cosmos algo on three arduinos
Each computes full algo
Isl exchange send of 
*own data to other two
*other two to other two
use majority vote
-> system has built-in redundancy

Implement emergency scenario: 
*one data direct transmission missing, go ahead
*one data totally missing:
-wait, continue assuming no change
-followers attempt master orbit then go to mode where ball. coefficients equals that if master
